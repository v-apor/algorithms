3: 06/07/2020:  Not all recursive algos are good, eg for fibonacci (which I failed to code) is O(2^N) whichc is way worse than iterative approach.
		> Recursion is cool when we want readable and DRY code (Don't repeat Yourself) but it leaves Large Stack memory footprint (bad for space).

	       + Insertion Sort (took me too much time to code; should always make logic before coding)
